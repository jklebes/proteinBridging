# proteinBridging

Code I used to analyse LAMMPS data for a university project, 2015.  
A polymer represeting DNA or chromatin was modelled as a series of spheres.  Dimeric protein molecules with attractive forces where added.
This code takes the positions of particles at times and extracts information such as radius of gyration, 
number and duration of contacts.
